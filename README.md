1. Event.java: This class will represent the Event object with fields like name, description, date & time.
2. EventController.java: This class will contain the API endpoints for adding, updating, deleting, and listing events.
3. EventService.java: This class will contain the business logic for managing events.
4. EventRepository.java: This class will manage the storage and retrieval of events in an ArrayList.
